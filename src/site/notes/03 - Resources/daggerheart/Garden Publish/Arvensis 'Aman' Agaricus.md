# Who is Aman?

Born into the esteemed Columnar House of the Agaricus Spawn, Aman was destined for a life of toil beneath the earth. As a [[03 - Resources/daggerheart/Garden Publish/The Agaricus Spawn Clan#Social Structure\|Saprotroph]], his role was clear: maintain and excavate the ever-expanding tunnel network that served as the colony's home. Though he diligently fulfilled his duties, protecting the delicate digging apparatus from the curious prods of subterranean creatures, Aman never truly fit the mold of a typical [[03 - Resources/daggerheart/Garden Publish/The Agaricus Spawn Clan#The Columnars\|Columnar]]. His physique, leaner and more agile than his burly brethren, often drew unwanted attention. While he maintained a facade of indifference, the constant teasing about his [[03 - Resources/daggerheart/Garden Publish/Visual Characteristics of the Houses of the Agaricus Clan#The Columnars\|"un-Columnar" physique]] gnawed at him, a persistent thorn in his otherwise content existence.

Aman did have some friends who tolerated him and his slightly unconventional behavior. Iangei, known as Angel, and Bellui, known as Billi, were fellow Saprotrophs assigned to protect the digging process. They had been raised together, their minds interfaced with the [[03 - Resources/daggerheart/Garden Publish/Fungril Glossary\|Dreaming Caps]] under the guidance of the same Pileus, and placed into the same working group. Angel and Billi often compensated for Aman's shortcomings, though there was no deep camaraderie between them. Despite their efforts, [[03 - Resources/daggerheart/Garden Publish/The Agaricus Spawn Clan#The Columnars\|the leader of the House]] would often reprimand the entire group for Aman's "insufficient" work.

Aman continued to fulfill his duties, striving for the colony's survival, as it was the only life he knew and the only life he believed in. Then came the surface missions, which were part of the protocol taught to him. These forays into the unfamiliar world above, with their vibrant hues and strange, alien creatures, offered a stark contrast to the monotony of tunnel life, a new experience that introduced Aman to new ways of learning outside of the Dreaming Caps.

## The Incident
One day, the trio was assigned to head to the surface again. This time, the order did not come from the usual channels. Instead, Linus Flavoagaricus, the leader of [[03 - Resources/daggerheart/Garden Publish/The Agaricus Spawn Clan#The Saffron Folk\|the Saffron Folk]], himself delivered the order, bypassing the usual Signal Weaver. The trio complied with the unusual order. It was notified to them through House leader Jinwei that Linus was prone to not following protocol – something Aman, before that conversation with Jinwei, would have never imagined. It was not for them to know the business of other houses, as it might compromise their own work, just as protocol indicated. They escorted Linus to the market, waited for him to return, and then headed back to the colony. This occurred a few more times in the coming months.

The last time Aman truly felt part of his home a Signal Weaver from The Saffron Folk arrived. They gave a parcel to Angel and instructed them to head to the market, enter the same location Linus used to frequent, deliver the parcel, and return. They followed orders because they must. They reached the tent in the market and entered. There they encountered what Aman had learned were ursine. Angel stepped forth and handed over the parcel, and the trio left. As Aman and Billi turned to leave, Angel stepped up and opened the package for the ursine. There Aman saw the impossible: a Dreaming Cap outside the colony. He turned to Billi, and they nodded to each other. They went into the offensive, trying to retrieve the Cap. Billi wielded a massive tooth as a greatsword (found one day while helping excavate the tunnels), and Aman fought with a shortsword. As they raced forward, Angel and the ursine fought back. In the ensuing fight, Billi and Aman escaped with the Cap in hand, Billi sustaining a near-fatal injury. Billi handed over his greatsword in exchange for Aman's sword and stayed to delay their pursuers. Aman did as instructed, and kept heading back to the colony. As Aman ran back into the depths of the underground, he accidentally phased with the Dreaming Cap, and saw visions of blood, fire, and the arcane. He saw a figure stand tall atop a hill only to have flames emerge from the palms of their hands. Then he was in the tunnels again, running. He headed towards the Stacks, where the Hidden Caps would know how to protect the Dreaming cap better than he could. Another vision, creatures from the Werewood running from the crimson fire, only to be struck down by bolts of black arcane energy, flashed before his eyes. He reached the entrance to the Stacks, and a Hidden Cap guard knocked Aman unconscious.

What followed was the ending of Aman's life at the colony. Aman had no idea that the Hidden Caps' protocol was to suppress any unauthorized individual with a Dreaming Cap outside of the Stacks. This information was meant to be kept from him, for the colony's benefit, as always. He was questioned by the Gill-Mimics' leader, recounting the events, but he was not believed. Angel's body was found, and information extracted from it contradicted Aman's testimony. He was blamed, charged with endangering the colony, breaking critical protocol, and stealing a valuable artifact from the colony. They cited his "insufficient" work as a source of his rebellion. He was to be killed the next day and have information extracted, after Gill-Mimic protocol was followed on the surface.

That night, in his cell, fury, a feeling he had never known before, erupted within Aman. He damned the Council, he damned Angel, and he damned the [[03 - Resources/daggerheart/Garden Publish/The Agaricus Spawn Clan\|The Agaricus Spawn Clan]]. He had spent 127 summers following protocol to the best of his ability, believing his actions were for the benefit of the colony. All for naught.

And suddenly, his cage door creaked open. Without hesitation, Aman leapt to the opportunity, running out and grabbing Billi's tooth before escaping the underground. He ran for days, certain that Gill-Mimics would be pursuing him. But they did not. Alone for the first time, he walked aimlessly, cursing protocol and cursing his home.

## Cheers for the present

Aman kept running, staying low to the ground. He survived by scavenging carcasses of animals and plants he found near roads, but he was always on the move. He ran until he saw the sea for the first time, reaching the land of the Gale.

During his frantic travels, Aman learned the hard way that consuming raw meat could leave him feeling lightheaded – a sensation he would later come to know as being "drunk." This unexpected side effect proved surprisingly useful when he began to be contacted mentally, as he once had been within the colony. The "drunkenness" would forcefully break these unwelcome connections. And he wanted nothing more than to sever all ties to the Agaricus, the life that had been forcibly taken from him.

In the Gale, Aman encountered a concept entirely new to him: money. Back in the colony, food was distributed without the need for such a thing – a concept that still baffles him to this day. He would be chased away from towns, forced to sell his sword to afford the allure of ale, as his "drunkenness" from scavenging often led to unwanted attention.

His newfound profession as a mercenary took him all over. Much of the time he found himself wishing he had been born a [[03 - Resources/daggerheart/Garden Publish/The Agaricus Spawn Clan#Social Structure\|Pileus]], someone with a broader education, to save himself from the headaches he had created for himself.

One day, an acquaintance asked him to be the captain of a vessel for a group that promised money. Needing more money to fuel his drinking, he accepted without fully understanding the implications.

Then he stole a boat. He decided it was his. Fuck protocol.

# Aman as a PC

For me, Aman is meant to be a character who is utterly lost. He doesn't know how to behave himself in the world of the surface; he's like a little kid who has been let loose.

He still carries the memories from back home, and some of the strict regulations that were ingrained in him when he was still a member of the Columnar House. That's the reason he's able to make these flashy moves in battle and has intricate rituals he follows, while at the same time not understanding all the intricacies of a system he was never raised into.

At this point in his life, Aman has embraced being outside of the colony, and whatever challenges it throws at him. But he still remembers from time to time what it meant to be a part of a whole, and how simple it was to stick to a ruleset and just act. He hates his colony for what happened to him, but if he were to find out what the whole affair was about and be allowed back home, I doubt much would keep him from making the choice of returning.
