# The Blood Fire Accord
## **Introduction**

The Blood Fire Accord is a landmark agreement signed by five clans of the Werewood following the devastating Blood Fires that ravaged the forest. The clans sought to establish a framework for cooperation and mutual support to aid in the recovery and ensure the survival of the woods and its inhabitants.

## **Key Provisions**

### Provision 1 
#### **Establishment of the Verdant Council**
The Accord establishes a General Council, composed of one representative from each signatory clan. The Council holds the authority to:
- **Coordinate policy:** Develop and implement policies related to the reconstruction of the Werewood, resource management, and the well-being of all inhabitants.
- **Resolve disputes:** Mediate and resolve conflicts between clans through diplomacy and negotiation.
- **Amend the Accord:** Review and amend the Accord as needed to address the changing circumstances and ensure its continued effectiveness.

### Provision 2
#### **Shared Responsibility for Reconstruction**
Each signatory clan commits to providing a specific and measurable contribution to the reconstruction of the Werewood. These contributions may include:
- **Labor:** Providing labor for reforestation efforts, rebuilding damaged infrastructure, and assisting members of the community.
- **Resources:** Contributing resources such as food and building materials to support the recovery efforts.
- **Joint planning and execution:** Participating in joint planning and execution of major reconstruction projects, ensuring coordinated efforts and maximizing the impact of available resources.
### Provision 3

#### **Resouce Sharing and Trade**
The Accord promotes the free and fair exchange of resources and goods between signatory clans.
- **Mother's Well Usage:** Access to Mother's Well is guaranteed to all signatory clans, with usage quotas established to ensure equitable access.
- **Trade agreements:** Clans may establish trade agreements with other clans and entities beyond the Werewood. However, all such agreements must be reviewed and approved by the General Council to ensure they do not:
	- **Disrupt the internal balance of trade and resource distribution** within the Werewood.
	- **Create undue advantages for any particular clan** to the detriment of others.
	- **Lead to conflicts or tensions** between clans within the Werewood.
### Provision 4

#### **Cleyra's Topiary as a Center of Coordination**
Cleyra's Topiary, under the shade of Father Oak, is designated as the official meeting place for the General Council and other inter-clan gatherings.
- **Rules of Procedure:** The Accord outlines rules of procedure for meetings held at Cleyra's Topiary, ensuring fair and equitable participation by all representatives.
### Provision 5

#### **Dispute Resolution Mechanism**
The Accord establishes a formal dispute resolution process:
- **Mediation:** In the event of a conflict between clans, the General Council shall first attempt to mediate a resolution through diplomacy and negotiation.
- **Arbitration:** If mediation fails, the dispute shall be referred to an impartial arbitrator chosen by mutual agreement among the involved clans.
- **Enforcement:** The General Council retains the authority to enforce the decisions of the arbitrator and impose penalties for violations of the Accord.


## **Significance**

The Blood Fire Accord transcended its initial purpose of post-disaster recovery. It laid the foundation for a shared identity and a sense of collective purpose among the clans of the Werewood. The Accord, in essence, became the cornerstone of a budding Werewood identity, paving the way for a more cohesive and unified future.

## **Criticisms**

- **Relevancy:** The Accord, initially conceived as a framework for post-disaster recovery, has become the cornerstone of inter-clan politics within the Werewood. However, its original focus on reconstruction has led to a lack of specificity and insufficient guardrails in addressing the complexities of modern Werewood society.
- **Military Considerations:** The Accord remains conspicuously silent on the role of military forces within the Werewood. While it is inferred that the General Council may utilize military power, the lack of explicit guidelines and safeguards regarding military deployment raises concerns about potential abuses and the potential for unintended consequences.
- **The Influence of the Agaricus Spawn:** As a primary architect of the Accord, [[03 - Resources/daggerheart/Garden Publish/The Agaricus Spawn Clan\|The Agaricus Spawn Clan]] holds significant influence within the current political framework. This prominent role has raised concerns among other clans regarding potential bias and the possibility of the Accord being unduly favorable to the Agaricus Spawn.
- **Lack of Flexibility:** The Accord, while a foundational document, lacks provisions for adapting to the evolving needs of the Werewood. Its reliance on the original five signatory clans presents challenges in accommodating new clans or addressing the potential dissolution or decline of existing clans.
