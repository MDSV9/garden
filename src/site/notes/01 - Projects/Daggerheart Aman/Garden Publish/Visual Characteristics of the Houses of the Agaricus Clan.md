# Visual Characteristics of the Houses of [[01 - Projects/Daggerheart Aman/Garden Publish/The Agaricus Spawn Clan\|The Agaricus Spawn Clan]]
## The Columnars

Columnars are typically characterized by their robust physique, reflecting their labor-intensive occupation. Their caps, often a shade of earthy brown, bear the marks of their tireless toil, rarely graced by the luxury of frequent cleansing. When cleaned, their caps reveal a rich reddish-brown hue. Their hands, large and calloused from years of digging through the subterranean tunnels.

## The Gill-Mimics

Slender and tall, Gill Mimics are distinguished by their pale purple coloration, most pronounced in the delicate hues of their caps. Often accompanied by elixirs to mitigate the side effects of their unique connection to the realm of death.

## The Hidden Caps

The Hidden Folk are the smallest of the clans, their stature dwarfed by their brethren. Their caps, though seemingly ordinary brown in daylight, emit a faint cyan glow in the darkness.

## The Saffron Folk

Saffron Folk are often seen draped in large, brown leaves, resembling robes, which they utilize to conceal their pale, almost bone-white skin. Their caps, a vibrant shade of reddish-yellow, are large enough to obscure their eyes, making them hard to negotiate with for inexperienced traders.
