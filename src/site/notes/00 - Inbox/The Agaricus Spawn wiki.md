## Introduction

The Agaricus Spawn is a colony of fungril people residing deep beneath Cleyra's Topiary. Their society revolves around four specialized Houses, each playing a vital role in the colony's survival and prosperity.

- [[00 - Inbox/The Agaricus Spawn wiki#The Gill-Mimics\|#The Gill-Mimics]] - Venture beyond the colony's borders to gather information, using fungril's unique connection to death.

- [[00 - Inbox/The Agaricus Spawn wiki#The Saffron Folk\|#The Saffron Folk]] - Manage resource acquisition, acting as the colony's interface with the outside world.

Following the [[Blood Fire Accord\|Blood Fire Accord]], the Agaricus Spawn established their home beneath Cleyra's Topiary. They contribute to the city by maintaining the sewage system and reside underneath. The colony prioritizes survival above all else, with a strict social structure that emphasizes efficiency and clear division of labor.

## Social Structure
### Hierarchy

The Agaricus Spawn operates under a rigid hierarchy. The Speaker, a respected elder chosen for their wisdom and historical knowledge, holds ultimate authority but mostly behaves as a mediator between the houses. The Council of Spores, comprised of representatives from each House, advises the Speaker. Each House has its own internal hierarchy, with roles assigned based on individual aptitudes from birth.

- **Signal Weavers:** Responsible for communication between Houses. This critical role demands unwavering focus, as disruptions could be fatal to the colony. Social mobility is restricted for Signal Weavers.
- **Saprotrophs:** Form the core workforce within each House, specializing in their designated tasks. They are eligible for Council membership and social advancement.
- **Pileus:** Oversee the upbringing of younglings (caps) and determine their future roles within the colony. Pileus members are the only ones who can become Speaker after the current one dies.

### The Four Houses

#### The Columnars

The largest House, tasked with maintaining and expanding the underground tunnels. Led by Jinwei Spissicaules, a staunch traditionalist and the eldest Council member. They collaborate with the Saffron Folk, exchanging excavated materials for essential supplies. 
#### The Gill-Mimics

Utilize their [Death Connection](<[Death Connection](https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/daggerheart/ancestries/fungril-playtest)>) to gather intelligence beyond the colony's borders, particularly near areas of conflict. Cymbi Pseudochitonia, known for breaking traditions and meddling with other Houses' Pileus, leads them with an iron fist.

#### The Hidden Caps

Caretakers of the Dreaming Caps, living repositories of knowledge. They are also responsible for protecting the Stacks, where the Dreaming Caps are stored. Led by Duneobello Minores son of the current speaker, a meticulous individual who continues to perform his duties as a Saprotroph despite his leadership role.
#### The Saffron Folk

Seen as the face of the colony to the outside world, they are often seen in the markets and near Mother's Well collecting clean water for the colony.
Led by [[Linus Flavoagaricus\|Linus Flavoagaricus]] son of Luteus Flavoagaricus. Youngest member of the council at 114 summers old, a talkative member of the council always butting heads with Jinwei Spissicaules regarding traditions that may get in the way of trade. 

## Culture and Beliefs

The Agaricus Spawn's culture is deeply intertwined with the Werewood environment. The Werewood provides both sustenance and challenges, shaping their beliefs and practices:

- **Reverence for Tradition:** The Fungril place a high value on tradition and the wisdom of their ancestors. Ancient rituals and practices are carefully preserved and passed down through generations.
- **The Importance of Knowledge:** Knowledge is highly valued within the colony. The Dreaming Caps serve as a repository of collective knowledge, and the Hidden Folk play a crucial role in preserving and disseminating this information.
- **Focus on Survival:** The constant struggle for survival has shaped the Fungril's pragmatic and cautious approach to the world. The rigid social structure and the emphasis on efficiency are designed to ensure the colony's long-term survival.
## History

According to Speaker [[Portobello Vedigaster\|Portobello Vedigaster]], the Houses were once separate colonies. The [[Blood Fire Accord\|Blood Fire Accord]] united them after a devastating fire nearly consumed the Weirwood.

Given the lack of a military, the Agaricus Spawn relied on intelligence to navigate relationships with other Weirwood clans before the General Council's establishment. Much of their history remains a mystery, as past Speakers and Councils deemed it best for only the Speaker to be privy to this information to maintain colony efficiency. The exodus of a forgotten House is often cited as a cautionary tale.

## Challenges and Threats

The Fungril Colony faces a number of challenges:

- **The Threat of Stagnation:** The rigid social structure and the emphasis on tradition, often without a clear understanding of the reasons behind these traditions, can stifle innovation and hinder the colony's ability to adapt to changing circumstances. This adherence to tradition without critical examination can lead to internal dissent and resistance to necessary change.

- **Internal Dissent:** The desire for individual freedom and the potential for social unrest are ongoing threats to the existing social order. The rigid social structure, which limits individual choice and mobility, can breed resentment and a desire for change.

- **External Threats:** As an integral part of the Weirwood, the Agaricus Spawn is intricately woven into the geopolitical conflicts that arise within the forest. Their lack of mobility makes them vulnerable to threats arising from these conflicts, as they are unable to easily relocate if their current location becomes unsafe.
